This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Gif Generator
In the project, I have used the gif api and there's a input search bar to get the results on hitting enter. Type anything you want.

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/nikzayn/gif-generator.git Then npm install And at last npm start

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
